The tables are currently organized by pay less the buy in. For example If I win $20 but I bought in for a total of $10, the 'pay' is $10. This is how tables are organized for cash games. If there's a tie, the person who stayed in longer is seen as having done better. For tournaments, they are organized by place regardless of any difference in buy in. Someday these tables might be organized differently, but we (Josh and Allyn) decided this was the best way for now.</div>
